Project Overview:
Create a personal budget tracker that allows users to record their income and expenses, categorize them, and track how they are doing financially over time. The application will provide visual reports on spending, remaining balance, and income vs. expense comparisons.

Features:
User Authentication (Optional):

Allow users to sign up, log in, and securely store their data.
Income and Expense Entry:

Let the user input income and expenses, with categories (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment).
Allow recurring income/expenses to be saved.
Data Storage:

Use a simple file-based database (e.g., JSON, CSV, or SQLite) to save user entries.
Visual Reports:

Generate visual charts (e.g., pie charts or bar graphs) showing income, expenses, and savings over time.
Optionally, include monthly/yearly comparisons of income and spending.
Expense and Budget Limits:

Allow users to set monthly budgets and track how much theyâ€™ve spent against those limits.
Analytics:

Calculate financial metrics such as total income, total expenses, savings, and expense percentage breakdowns.
Tech Stack:
Core Python Libraries:

datetime for managing dates.
matplotlib or plotly for creating visualizations.
json or sqlite3 for data storage.
Additional Features:

If you want to take it further, you could add a GUI using tkinter or PyQt, or you could use a web framework like Flask or Django if you want to take it to the web.
Steps to Get Started:
Set up the environment:

Create a new Python environment using venv or conda.
Install libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, and sqlite3.
Create a basic structure:

Implement a simple program that allows the user to input data for income and expenses.
Save the data in a file like expenses.json or a database like expenses.db.
Generate reports:

Use matplotlib to create visualizations showing the breakdown of income and expenses.
Expand functionality:

Add categories for expenses (e.g., food, rent, utilities).
Add a budget feature that notifies the user when they are approaching or exceeding their budget.
User Interface:

Consider building a command-line interface (CLI) or a basic graphical interface.
